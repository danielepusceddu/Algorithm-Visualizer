Algorithm Visualizer. Graphics handled by SFML. Gif saving functionality handled by gif-h.
Work in progress.

Command Line Arguments:
-a {algorithm}      Algorithm can be: bubblesort, insertsort, selectionsort
-e {vectorSize}     vectorSize can be any number greater than 0.
-s {milliseconds}   Milliseconds to wait before executing the next step of the algorithm.
-r                  This tells the program to record the visualization and save it to a gif. Might slow the program down.
