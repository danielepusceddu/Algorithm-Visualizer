Algorithm Visualizer. Graphics handled by SFML. Gif saving functionality handled by gif-h.<br/>
Work in progress.<br/>

Command Line Arguments:<br/>
-a {algorithm}      Algorithm can be: bubblesort, insertsort, selectionsort<br/>
-e {vectorSize}     vectorSize can be any number greater than 0.<br/>
-s {milliseconds}   Milliseconds to wait before executing the next step of the algorithm.<br/>
-r                  This tells the program to record the visualization and save it to a gif. Might slow the program down.
